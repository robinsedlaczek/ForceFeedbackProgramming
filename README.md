# Force Feedback Programming

## Overview

Make evolvability really tangible while coding: that's what _Force Feedback Programming_ (FFP) is about.

There are tools which might be able to tell you during CI if you wrote clean code. Or your colleagues give you feedback on this during a review. But that's pretty delayed feedback. It's hard to learn from it for next time. To write clean code in the first place still is not inevitable.

That hopefully changes with FFP! Because FFP will tell you right away _while you're typing_ how you're doing on the evolvability front.

And not only will FFP tell you how clean your code is, it will actively hinder you to pollute it. _FFP gives you visual feedback plus tactile._ You'll experience a real force right at your fingertips! Writing less clean code will become tangibly harder.

And all this is made possible through a simple Visual Studio extension you can even [adapt to your coding style](CONFIG.md) and level of brownfield.

Enjoy!

PS: If you like what you see and have time to spare, you can join us in moving the FFP extension forward. Please [check the wiki](https://github.com/robinsedlaczek/ForceFeedbackProgramming/wiki) for details.
